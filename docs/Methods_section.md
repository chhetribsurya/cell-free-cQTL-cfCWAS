## Cell-free chromatin quantitative trait locus analysis

Cell-free chromatin quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) were identified from cell-free ChIP-seq data as previously described. We applied a combined false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of q ≤ 0.05 across multiple histone modification datasets to filter candidate cQTLs. To ensure robust statistical comparisons, matched random background sets were generated by sampling from the full pool of available cQTLs that passed equivalent significance thresholds. This approach maintains comparable statistical power and preserves the underlying genomic distribution characteristics of the original dataset.

## Regulatory region annotation and classification

Regulatory region annotations were derived from chromatin state segmentation data provided by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Using 18-state chromHMM models across 127 reference epigenomes, we focused on histone modification profiles that characterize active regulatory elements. Active regulatory states encompass a range of chromatin signatures, including active transcription start sites (TSS), genic and active enhancers, weak enhancers, and bivalent regulatory elements. Following standard chromHMM nomenclature, these states include: 1_TssA (Active TSS), 2_TssFlnk (Flanking TSS), 3_TssFlnkU (Flanking TSS Upstream), 4_TssFlnkD (Flanking TSS Downstream), 7_EnhG1 (Genic Enhancer 1), 8_EnhG2 (Genic Enhancer 2), 9_EnhA1 (Active Enhancer 1), 10_EnhA2 (Active Enhancer 2), 11_EnhWk (Weak Enhancer), 14_TssBiv (Bivalent TSS), and 15_EnhBiv (Bivalent Enhancer).

The 127 reference epigenomes were stratified into three developmental categories: fetal tissues (13 epigenomes; EIDs: E017, E093, E082, E081, E089, E090, E083, E092, E085, E084, E086, E088, E080), stem cells (22 epigenomes; E002, E008, E001, E015, E014, E016, E003, E024, E020, E019, E018, E021, E022, E007, E009, E010, E013, E012, E011, E004, E005, E006), and adult tissues (80 epigenomes). From each developmental category, genomic regions exhibiting the active regulatory states described above were extracted, resulting in three distinct regulatory region sets. Developmental-specific regions were subsequently defined as the union of fetal and stem cell regulatory regions, with any regions overlapping adult-specific regulatory annotations explicitly excluded.

## Specificity category definition

Regulatory regions exhibiting tissue-specific activity patterns were identified through set-based operations on the fetal, stem cell, and adult regulatory region annotations. We defined four mutually exclusive specificity categories: (1) fetal-specific regions, which are active exclusively in fetal tissues; (2) stem cell-specific regions, active exclusively in stem cell epigenomes; (3) developmental-specific regions, active in fetal and/or stem cell tissues but absent in adult tissues; and (4) adult-specific regions, active exclusively in adult tissues. BEDTools intersection operations were employed to implement these classifications, which ensures complete mutual exclusivity between categories while providing comprehensive coverage of the regulatory landscape.

## Overlap enrichment analysis

Enrichment of cQTLs within each specificity category was assessed through overlap analysis using BEDTools. The number of cQTLs overlapping regulatory regions in each category was calculated, and statistical significance was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. This test compared overlap frequencies between the cQTL set and a size-matched random background. To generate the random background, we randomly sampled from the full set of cQTLs at equivalent significance thresholds, maintaining the same total number of regions as the test set. By matching both sample size and statistical thresholds, this design ensures that any observed enrichment reflects genuine biological specificity rather than artifacts arising from differences in statistical power or genomic distribution.

Fisher's exact test was implemented using a 2×2 contingency table that compared overlapping and non-overlapping regions between the cQTL set and the random background. Odds ratios were calculated directly from the contingency table. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the odds ratios were computed using the log transformation method (Wald method), where the standard error of the log odds ratio was calculated as the square root of the sum of the reciprocals of all cell counts in the contingency table: SE(log OR) = √(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d), where a, b, c, and d represent the four cells of the 2×2 table. The confidence intervals were then obtained by exponentiating the log odds ratio ± 1.96 × SE(log OR). Fold enrichment was computed as the ratio of overlap frequencies using the formula: (n_overlap_test / n_total_test) / (n_overlap_random / n_total_random).

## Permutation testing

Permutation testing was performed to validate the robustness of enrichment findings and to provide empirical significance estimates. For each specificity category, 100 independent random samples were generated from the full background set, with each sample matched in size to the test cQTL set. A fixed random seed of 50 was used to ensure reproducibility across all analyses. Within each permutation, we calculated the overlap with regulatory regions and computed the corresponding fold enrichment and odds ratio. The empirical p-value was determined as the proportion of permutations where the fold enrichment or odds ratio equaled or exceeded the observed value, calculated using the formula: p_empirical = (n_permutations ≥ observed + 1) / (n_permutations + 1).

## Cis-regulatory element enrichment analysis

To provide complementary evidence for the functional relevance of identified cQTLs, we assessed their enrichment within experimentally validated cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Overlap analysis was performed between cQTLs and cell-free DNA CRE annotations that were derived from ChIP-seq data. This analysis employed the same statistical framework as the developmental specificity analysis described above. Specifically, we compared the overlap frequency of the test cQTL set with CREs against a size-matched random background, using Fisher's exact test combined with permutation testing (100 permutations) to assess significance. Together with the developmental specificity analysis, these results provide converging evidence for the functional relevance of identified cQTLs within active regulatory contexts.

## Data processing and computational methods

All genomic coordinate operations were performed using BEDTools (v2.30.0) with the human reference genome assembly hg19. Chromosome coordinates were standardized to include the "chr" prefix, and all genomic intervals were converted to 0-based, half-open coordinate format as required by BED format specifications. Statistical analyses were conducted in Python (v3.x) using scipy.stats for Fisher's exact tests and numpy for numerical computations. Permutation sampling was implemented using Python's random module with fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility. Visualization and plotting were performed using matplotlib and R (ggplot2 package).
